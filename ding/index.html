    <h2>DinG</h2>
    
    <p><i>DinG — Dialogues in Games</i> is a corpus of manual transcriptions of real-life, oral, spontaneous multi-party dialogues between French-speaking players of <i>Catan</i> (Copyright ©2017 CATAN Studio, Inc. and CATAN GmbH, all rights reserved). <i>Catan</i> is a board game for three to four players in which the main goal for each participant is to make their settlement prosper and grow, using resources that are scarce. Bargaining over these resources is a major part of the gameplay and constitutes the core of DinG‘s data. The corpus has been designed partly to showcase the <a href='https://team.inria.fr/semagramme/fr/projects/slam/'>SLAM corpus</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Dialogues from <i>DinG</i> are unconstrained, as the players don’t have to follow any rule or specific guideline, apart from playing the game. As bargaining over the resources is part of the gameplay, the players have to speak in order to play, so the dialogues are the ones naturally occurring in this particular setting. As the players have to speak to play, they do not discuss personal subjects outside the game setting, which makes it possible to completely anonymize the corpus by removing the players’ names (de-identification).

    The corpus is available on Gitlab: https://gitlab.inria.fr/semagramme-public-projects/resources/ding/. It is distributed under the Attribution ShareAlike Creative Commons license (CC BY-SA 4.0).
